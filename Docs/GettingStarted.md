# Getting Started

To get started with development include a copy of the Oxide.Ext.Discord.dll with your project assembly references.
If you would like to see all the documentation for the dll displayed in your IDE be sure to include the [Oxide.Ext.Discord.xml](../Oxide.Ext.Discord/Oxide.Ext.Discord.xml) in the same path
