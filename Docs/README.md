# Getting Started

To get started with development include a copy of the Oxide.Ext.Discord.dll with your project assembly references references.
The Discord Extension has XML documentation that allows your IDE to see information about methods and fields from the extension.
If you would like to see this extra information you can include the [Oxide.Ext.Discord.xml](../Oxide.Ext.Discord/Oxide.Ext.Discord.xml) in the same directory as the Discord Extension DLL
